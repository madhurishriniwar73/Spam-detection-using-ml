# Spam-detection-using-machine learning
  In recent years, the increasing popularity and low cost of e-mail have attracted the attention of direct marketers. Using readily available bulk-mailing software and large lists of e-mail addresses, typically harvested from web pages and newsgroup archives, it is now possible to send blindly unsolicited messages to thousands of recipients at essentially no cost. 
  As a result of this, it is becoming increasingly common for users to receive daily large quantities of unsolicited bulk e-mail, known as spam, advertising anything from vacations to get-rich schemes. The term Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) is also used in the literature. We use “spam” with a broader meaning, that does not exclude unsolicited bulk e-mail sent for non-commercial purposes (e.g. to communicate a message from a sectarian group)
The characteristics of spam messages (e.g. topics, frequent terms) change over time, requiring the keyword patterns to be updated periodically . It is, therefore, desirable to develop anti-spam filters that will learn automatically how to block spam messages by processing previously received spam and legitimate messages
